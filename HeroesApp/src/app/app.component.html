    <!-- The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule. When using the command "ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app" at the start of implementing the routerModule, this import (router-outlet) was added because of the --module=app flag. If you manually created app-routing.module.ts or used a tool other than the CLI to do so, you'll need to import AppRoutingModule into app.module.ts and add it to the imports array of the NgModule. -->
